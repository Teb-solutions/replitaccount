# Intercompany Reference Matching Fix

## Issue Fixed
Invoice creation was finding purchase orders incorrectly - it was matching by company relationships instead of using the specific reference number from the sales order.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the intercompany invoice creation to:
1. Get the reference number from the sales order
2. Find the purchase order with the exact matching reference number
3. Link the created bill to the correct purchase order

## Code Changes
In `/api/intercompany/invoice` endpoint:
- Added query to get sales order reference number
- Modified purchase order lookup to match by reference number
- Ensures proper intercompany transaction linking

## Verification Results
Tested with authentic database data:
- 5 matched sales/purchase order pairs found with identical references
- Sales order 165 (ref: A0466) correctly matches purchase order 52 (ref: A0466)
- Complete transaction workflow properly maintained
